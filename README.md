# HomeScreen
A Home Screen with three lists Hotspots, Events and Attractions all of them returned
from an API.

Home Screen contains a Button (BellMan Button) to show and hide floatoing button with animation.

Using Volley Library to manages the network requests and get JSON data from URL.

For image loading I used Picasso library.

And YoYo Animations to control the BellMan Button Animation.
